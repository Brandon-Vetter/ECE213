# ECE213
Files for ECE 213 that I can edit - should be simular consept to the ECE 211 lab.\
I am making the repository as I am unable to edit the canvas and want to be able to make small changes to lab handouts, and make sure that everyone is using the same labhandout.  I also want to be able to upload example lab reports, and upload any simulations/code I make for this lab.\
Below is a more accurate sylybus for the class and how I will be grading assigments

# Grading:
Lab reports: 60% \

Lab Final: 30% 

Lab reports will be broken into two different catagories - Participation, and the actual report.  Half of the report will be showing up and doing the lab, the other half will be the report itself.  This means that the report itself is worth 30% of your grade, and lab participation is worht 30% of your grade. 

The lab final will be 100 points. It will mostly be questions about the concepts leanrned in lab, but may also have questions about things learned in class. It will be indiviudally completed. 

# Late Work
Lab reports will be due at the end the following lab giving you a week to do it.  Late work will not be accepted unless approved by the TA before the due date.  Reach out to your TA if you need more time.  Pre labs will be due Tuesday before lab.  Late Prelabs will not be accepted.
